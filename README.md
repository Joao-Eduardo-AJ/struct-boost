# Just a landing page made to train my skills with tailwind and Next.js.

This is not a real application, just like your theme, I just focused on making everything responsive and beautiful to learn more about tailwind and nextjs, and this was the [result](https://struct-boost-tau.vercel.app/).<br>
If you insist, you can run it locally by following the steps below...

### First, clone the repository with a URL, SSH key or GH CLI

### Then, at the root of the project, install all dependences:
```bash
npm install
```
or
```bash
yarn install
```

### Finally, to view the application in the browser via localhost:
```bash
npm run dev
```
or
```bash
yarn dev
```
